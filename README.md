# Savoury Search Frontend Documentation

Welcome to the frontend of the TCR final project, Savoury Search. This README provides an overview of the frontend and its technologies.

## Project Overview

Savoury Search is a project focused on creating a user-friendly web application for browsing through recipes others have posted or post your own recipes. This repository contains the frontend component of the project.

## Technology Stack

The frontend of Savoury Search is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a powerful and versatile React framework that brings several advantages to the project, such as server-side rendering, routing, and a great developer experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the project. It offers a utility-first approach to CSS, making it easy to create custom designs while maintaining a consistent and maintainable codebase.
